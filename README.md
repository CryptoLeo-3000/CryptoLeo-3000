## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kartik Padave, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and an aspiring Data Scientist.

Since a young age, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. So that's how I look at big data sets, it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is a challenge to me.

On my website you can find my projects, most of them are links to a website, prototypes or interactive visualization.
